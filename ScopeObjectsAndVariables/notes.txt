In JavaScript, scope is the set of variables, objects, and functions you have access to.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.

Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.

unction arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.
