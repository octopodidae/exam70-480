The error object provides two useful properties: name and message.

Six different values can be returned by the error name property:

 - Error Name	Description
 - EvalError	An error has occurred in the eval() function
 - RangeError	A number "out of range" has occurred
 - ReferenceError	An illegal reference has occurred
 - SyntaxError	A syntax error has occurred
 - TypeError	A type error has occurred
 - URIError	An error in encodeURI() has occurred

 A RangeError is thrown if you use a number that is outside the range of legal values.
