The error object provides two useful properties: name and message.

Six different values can be returned by the error name property:

 - Error Name	Description
 - EvalError	An error has occurred in the eval() function
 - RangeError	A number "out of range" has occurred
 - ReferenceError	An illegal reference has occurred
 - SyntaxError	A syntax error has occurred
 - TypeError	A type error has occurred
 - URIError	An error in encodeURI() has occurred

 A RangeError is thrown if you use a number that is outside the range of legal values.

The try…catch block is divided into two parts.
The first part, the try portion, says, “Try to do this work.” If anything
If anything goes wrong when trying to do the work, the catch block receives
an exception object with information about the error.

The catch block is where the error can be handled as appropriate for the application. The
catch block receives a parameter that is an exception object.

Properties available on the exception object

 - message : A textual description of the error that occurred
 - number : A numeric error code
 - name : The name of the exception object

 finally block. This block is added directly after
 the catch block. The significance of the finally block is that the code inside it runs all the time.
